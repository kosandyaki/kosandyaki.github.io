	   The Garment District is a neighborhood located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The dense concentration of fashion-related uses give the neighborhood its name. 
	   
	   The neighborhood, less than 1 square mile, is generally considered to lie between Fifth Avenue and Ninth Avenue, from 34th to 42nd Streets.  
	   
	   The neighborhood is home to many of New York City's showrooms and to numerous major fashion labels, and caters to all aspects of the fashion process from design and production to wholesale selling. 
	   
	   The Garment District has been known since the early 20th century as the center for fashion manufacturing and fashion design in the the world.
